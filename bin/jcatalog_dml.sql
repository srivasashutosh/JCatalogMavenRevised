It is particularly suited, by design, for use with applications based on the MVC architecture. Numerous articles have been published to introduce JSF. However, most of them take a highly theoretical approach that does not meet the challenges of real-world enterprise development. There are still a lot of issues that need to be solved. For example, how JSF fits INTO the overall MVC architecture? How JSF integrates with other Java frameworks? Should business logic exist in the JSF backing beans? How to handle security in JSF? And most importantly, how to build a real-world web application using JSF? This article addresses all these issues.
